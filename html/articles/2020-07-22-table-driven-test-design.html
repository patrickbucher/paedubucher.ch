            <div class="content"><p>Many universities teach programming in Java. Writing unit tests is one of the
subjects being taught. Many professional Java programmers, but also university
professors, suggest to build those test cases according to a pattern. <em>Given,
When, Then</em> is a common pattern, and so is <em>Arrange, Act, Assert</em>. Both patterns
prescribe the following structure for a test case:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Given</em>/<em>Arrange</em>: An environment (in the broadest sense) is built up.</li>
<li><em>When</em>/<em>Act</em>: The function or method to be tested is invoked.</li>
<li><em>Then</em>/<em>Assert</em>: The result of the function or method is checked against some
   expectation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Such a test case might look as follows (Java):</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>public void testAddition() {
    // Given/Arrange
    Calculator calc = new Calculator();
    int a = 3;
    int b = 5;

    // When/Act
    sum = calc.add(a, b);

    // Then/Assert
    assertEqual(8, sum);
}
</code></pre>

<p>A rule often taught is the so-called <em>single assert rule</em> from Robert C. Martin,
<a href="http://marmaro.de/apov/txt/2016-04-27_schaedlicher-kult.txt">whom I refuse to call «Uncle
Bob»</a>. It states
that there should be only one assertion per test case. One can argue whether or
not this rule is useful.</p>
<h1>Unclean Code</h1>
<p>However, in my experience this rule leads to a consequence I do not like ‒ and
which also doesn't fit into the <em>Clean Code</em> philosophy (or <em>cult</em>, I daresay):
The programming language being used to write test code is a small subset of the
implementation language, often degenerating into a sheer sequence of statements
(imperative programming).</p>
<p>Even though using a subset of a language is often a sensible approach (just
think about C++, or <code>with</code> and <code>eval</code> in JavaScript, or <code>unsafe</code> in Go, etc.),
using a subset of a language that doesn't even contain core features from
structured programming (decisions, loops, data structures) does not sound
sensible to me, except when programming in a purely functional style.</p>
<p>How should an additional test case to cover, say, negative numbers, be added to
the one above? The <em>single assert rule</em> wants us to write an additional test
case:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>public void testAdditionWithNegativeNumbers() {
    // Given/Arrange
    Calculator calc = new Calculator();
    int a = -1;
    int b = 3;

    // When/Act
    sum = calc.add(a, b);

    // Then/Assert
    assertEqual(2, sum);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Who would <em>type</em> in that code, which is almost identical to the one above? Such
code is rather <em>copied</em> than written again. (Why don't I hear somebody shouting
<em>«Clean Code!!!!11»</em> now?)</p>
<h1>Structured Programming to the Rescue</h1>
<p>Let's violate the <em>single assert rule</em> for a minute and bring back structured
programming. Let's write a unit test in C!</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>typedef struct {
    int a;
    int b;
    int expected;
} addition_test_case;

void test_addition()
{
    addition_test_case tests[] = {
        {3, 5, 8},
        {-1, 3, 2},
    };
    int n = sizeof(tests) / sizeof(tests[0]);
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
        addition_test_case test = tests[i];
        int actual = add(test.a, test.b);
        if (actual != test.expected) {
            printf(&quot;add(%d, %d): expected %d, got %d\n&quot;,
                    test.a, test.b, test.expected, actual);
            exit(1);
        }
    }
    printf(&quot;test_addition: %d tests passed\n&quot;, n);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This test case, which does not make use of any unit testing framework, was
designed in a <em>table-driven</em> manner. I first got to know the concept of
<em>table-driven test design</em> when learning Go by reading <a href="http://www.gopl.io/">The Go Programming
Language</a> (p. 306) by Alan A. A. Donovan and the great
Brian W. Kernighan.</p>
<p>However, the concept must predate Go, for I can at least remember one article by
Rob Pike, who later designed Go, mentioning table-driven test design.
(Ironically ‒ or not so ironically ‒ that article was a critique of
object-oriented programming, as far as I can remember.)</p>
<h1>Table-Driven Test Design</h1>
<p>Let's break down the parts that make up a table-driven test design.</p>
<p>First, a single test case is defined using a structure that contains all the
input parameters, and the expected result of the test:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>typedef struct {
    int a;
    int b;
    int expected;
} addition_test_case;
</code></pre>

<p>Second, an array ‒ the test <em>table</em> ‒ containing all the test definitions is
defined (<em>Given</em>/<em>Arrange</em>):</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>addition_test_case tests[] = {
    {3, 5, 8},
    {-1, 3, 2},
};
</code></pre>

<p>Third, the test table is processed using a <em>loop</em> (structured programming,
remember that?):</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>int n = sizeof(tests) / sizeof(tests[0]);
for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
    // omitted
}
</code></pre>

<p>For every test case, the result is computed (<em>Act</em>/<em>When</em>):</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>addition_test_case test = tests[i];
int actual = add(test.a, test.b);
</code></pre>

<p>Fourth, the result is validated against the definition (<em>Then</em>/<em>Assert</em>):</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>if (actual != test.expected) {
    printf(&quot;add(%d, %d): expected %d, got %d\n&quot;,
            test.a, test.b, test.expected, actual);
    exit(1);
}
printf(&quot;test_addition: %d tests passed\n&quot;, n);
</code></pre>

<p>An error message is printed if the <code>actual</code> value is not equal to the <code>expected</code>
value (in case <code>add</code> was implemented incorrectly):</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>add(3, 5): exptected 8, got 666
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this test terminates after the first error. No assertions are used.
The lack of a test framework is compensated by manually defined error and
success messages.</p>
<p>Yes, I'm well aware of the fact that there are unit testing libraries in C. The
point is that this C code covering two test cases is only slightly longer than
the Java code to cover the same amount of test cases would be. (Using Python or
Go rather than C would have shaved off some additional lines.)</p>
<p>Now let's add a third and a fourth test case:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>addition_test_case tests[] = {
    {3, 5, 8},
    {-1, 3, 2},
    {13, 17, 30}, // new
    (-100, 100, 0}, // new
};
</code></pre>

<p>No code was copied. No existing code was modified. Only <em>two</em> lines of code were
added to define <em>two</em> additional test cases. The table-driven test is
<em>extensible</em>.  Robert C. Martin would love it, wouldn't he?</p>
<h1>Comparing Apples to Rotten Tomatoes</h1>
<p>So why isn't everybody writing table-driven tests instead of triple-A copy-paste
tests?</p>
<p>First, some programming languages make it harder to define data structures as
literals. Languages like JavaScript, Python, or Go are quite good at that. Even
C, as shown above, can be quite concise when it comes to defining static data
structures. Java recently got better at that, but up to version 8, defining a
static map structure was done by adding single elements subsequently. (Why don't
I hear <em>«DRY principle!!!1»</em> now?)</p>
<p>Second, the unit testing framework plays an important role. In C, (at least as
shown above), and in Go (as it is done using the standard library), no
assertions are used. The programmer instead performs the checks manually and
reacts with a reasonable error message. The programmer is supposed to <em>program</em>
the tests.</p>
<p>Some unit testing frameworks that do make use of assertions also allow to add
custom error messages to every <code>assert</code> call. Other frameworks, such as
<a href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a>, just will tell you <em>on which line</em> an assertion
failed. This is not very useful when having assertions within a loop, for the
programmer does not know which test case failed. At least for Jest, writing pure
sequential assertion code is a necessity, and the <em>single assert rule</em> looks
quite reasonable from that perspective.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/">PyTest</a> framework, for example, has
table-driven test design built-in, by providing the static test definitions
through a decorator, which is basically an annotation in Java lingo. (Check
<code>@pytest.mark.parametrize</code> for details.) However, this approach makes it
impossible to include information into the test table that needs prior
construction within the test function.</p>
<p>More recent versions of JUnit also allow for parametrized tests (check out the
<code>@ParametrizedTest</code> and <code>@ValueSource</code> annotations). The restrictions stated
above for PyTest also apply here. Again, the poor programmer is put into
straightjacket, for he's not supposed to <em>program</em>, but only to <em>test</em>.</p>
<p>My favourite test framework is from the Go standard library, which on one hand
gives the programmer total flexibility, and on the other hand provides an useful
API to construct small but powerful test runners. Checkout the
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/testing/">testing</a> package for details. (And read <a href="https://gopl.io">The
Go Programming Language</a> by all means, even if you don't need
to learn Go. You'll pick up a lot about computer science in this book.)</p>
<h1>Single Assert Rule Revisited</h1>
<p>The discussion about testing frameworks and programming languages (and text
editors, and tabs vs. spaces) could be extended here ad nauseam. But let's
review the <em>single assert rule</em> instead, which could be interpreted from two
perspectives:</p>
<ol>
<li>Runtime: <code>assert</code> should only be called once per execution of every test
   function/method.</li>
<li>Code: There should only be one reference to <code>assert</code> in every test
   function/method.</li>
</ol>
<p>While the first interpretation makes table-driven design impossible, the second
interpretation might be closer to the rule's original intention: Each test case
should only verify one aspect of the function/method being called.</p>
<p>I'll therefore continue to happily violate the first interpretation of the rule,
for the advantages of table-driven test design (extensibility, flexibility, more
concise code) outhweigh the indiscriminate application of some hand-wavy
statements about «doing only one thing» by far. Please let me just <em>program</em>
those tests…</p>
<p>As an additional example, check out my test cases for some time formatting
routines
(<a href="https://github.com/patrickbucher/countdown/blob/master/test_timefmt.c">test_timefmt.c</a>).
Here, the test table can be used in two directions: One function uses the left
value as input and the right value as the expected outcome, while the other
function does the opposite. Here, <em>two</em> new test cases are defined by adding
<em>one</em> (very short) line of code.</p>
<p>Am <em>I</em> allowed to shout <em>«Clean Code!»</em> and <em>«DRY principle!»</em> now, by the way?</p></div>
