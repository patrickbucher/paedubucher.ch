        <h2 class="subtitle">Say Goodbye to the Swiss Keyboard Layout</h2>

        <div class="content"><p>I've been using the Swiss keyboard layout for most of my life. Things changed
when I first had to work on a Mac Book. If the Swiss keyboard layout is not
great for programming on a usual keyboard, because it requires combinations with
Alt-Gr to type in braces and brackets, I consider the Mac version of it outright
horrible, because braces and brackets are located on the digits row. Those
symbols are not even painted onto their respective keys, which makes the
transition for non-Mac users even harder.</p>
<h1>Entering the US Keyboard Layout</h1>
<p>So instead of learning an additional inefficient way of typing in special
characters, I decided to adopt to the US keyboard layout. This layout gives you
most characters required for programming with a single key or a combination of
Shift and another key.</p>
<p>One issue of the US layout is that it doesn't provide characters such as <em>ö</em> or
<em>é</em>, which I still need to type in for emails, for documentation, and for this
article, of course. Mac OS provides a composing mechanism that lets you type a
double quote followed by a letter like <em>o</em>, and then combines those characters
to the German umlaut <em>ö</em>.  If you just want to type a double quotation mark,
you need to type Space right after it, so that the quotation mark is not
attempted to be combined with the next character entered. This is annoying, of
course, when programming. So I never really got warm with the Mac keyboard
layout and input method. An external keyboard with US layout didn't help much
in that respect, but at least allowed me to type in those cumbersome
combinations faster and more precisely.</p>
<h1>Switching Keyboard Layouts</h1>
<p>Another solution to the goal conflict of typing in German umlauts and special
programming characters as fast as possible is to switch the keyboard layout as
needed. I'm very familier with this approach, because I use the Russian keyboard
layout once in a while. I modified my <a href="http://dwm.suckless.org/">dwm</a>
configuration so that pressing Super+Tab changes my keyboard layout using the
following script (<code>switchkb</code>):</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-sh linenums">#!/bin/sh

layout=&quot;$(setxkbmap -query | grep layout | egrep -o [a-z]{2}$)&quot;
if [ &quot;$layout&quot; == &quot;ch&quot; ]; then
    setxkbmap ru
elif [ &quot;$layout&quot; = &quot;ru&quot; ]; then
    setxkbmap us 
elif [ &quot;$layout&quot; = &quot;us&quot; ]; then
    setxkbmap ch
fi
</code></pre>

<p>This lets me cycle through the keyboard layouts I need very quickly. I also
display the currently active keyboard layout in my status bar using
<a href="http://tools.suckless.org/slstatus/">slstatus</a>, which I described in a
<a href="https://paedubucher.ch/articles/2020-09-05-openbsd-on-the-desktop-part-i.html">previous
article</a>.
Even though this is a feasible solution, I still have to switch mentally between
the Swiss German and the US keyboard layout. Typing in a double quote in a German
email requires me to press another key than typing in that very same character
when programming. This additional mental burden is wearing me down on a usual
working day, which consists of roughly 70% programming and 30% communicating.
The communication part might actually be bigger, but some of the communication
also takes part in English, so that I'd be better off using the US rather than
the Swiss German keyboard layout.</p>
<p>Typing cyrillic letters still requires the Russian keyboard layout, so I won't
get rid of my <code>switchkb</code> script and Super+Tab. However, since typing in
punctuation marks using the Russian keyboard layout is almost the same as
typing in those characters on the US keyboard layout, I rather ditch my native
Swiss German layout and embrace the imperialistic option.</p>
<h1>Composing Characters</h1>
<p>While being able to write source code faster and not having to distinguish
between English, German, and Russian when typing in punctuation marks sounds
great in terms of <em>efficiency</em>, not typing in the typographically correct
representations of German umlauts (<em>Ae</em>, <em>Oe</em>, <em>Ue</em> instead of <em>Ä</em>, <em>Ö</em>, <em>Ü</em>)
or misspelling French words with accent marks (<em>depecherent</em> instead of
<em>dépêchèrent</em>) is bad in terms of communicating <em>effectively</em>. So there must be
at least a way to type in those characters somewhat efficiently.</p>
<p>One option would be to type in those characters as hexadecimal Unicode code
points.  I've already learned a few thereof by heart, such as U+2012, U+2013,
and U+2014 for dashes of different lenghts, or simple to remember ones like
U+00ab and U+00bb for guillemets (<em>«»</em>). In <code>vim</code>, those sequences can be
entered by presing Ctrl+V U followed by the part after U+. In GTK applications,
Ctrl+U enters a mode to enter those codes to be finished with a Space (or maybe
some other character not representing a hexadecimal digit).</p>
<p>However, remembering a lot of Unicode code points is not a very intuitive way
to type and probably leads to a lot of lookups on
<a href="https://www.fileformat.info">FileFormat.Info</a>, which is at least a more
sophisticated way than just googling those character code points, which usually
ends up on FileFormat.Info anyway, or, worse, on a big Wikipedia page
discussing the history and cultural significance of the <code>LATIN SMALL LETTER C
WITH CEDILLA</code> (<em>ç</em>) before giving me it's code point U+00e7.</p>
<h2>Entering the Compose Key</h2>
<p>A better option is certainly the <em>Compose Key</em>. (Check out this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compose_key">Wikipedia
Article</a> for a discussion of its
history and cultural significance). Even though not even the nerdiest of nerd
keyboards come with a physical compose key nowadays, the X Window System still
supports the underlying mechanism. And since X is running on both my Arch Linux
and OpenBSD computers, using its compose key mechanism helps me both at work
and for my private computing, the latter consisting mostly of writing articles
about entering special characters on special computing setups and the like.</p>
<p>A good reference for this mechanism is the manual page <code>Compose(5)</code> or
<code>XCompose(5)</code> on both Arch Linux and OpenBSD. (I guess it also applies to
FreeBSD, but I didn't check yet). However, there's some additional information
required to do a basic setup, so here's a quick guide.</p>
<p>First, a compose key needs to be picked. There are various options, which can be
looked up as follows:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code># OpenBSD
$ grep 'compose:' /usr/X11R6/share/X11/xkb/rules/base.lst

# Arch Linux
$ grep 'compose:' /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/base.lst
</code></pre>

<p>Which shows a list of keys that could be used for the compose key:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>  compose:ralt         Right Alt
  compose:lwin         Left Win
  compose:lwin-altgr   3rd level of Left Win
  compose:rwin         Right Win
  compose:rwin-altgr   3rd level of Right Win
  compose:menu         Menu
  compose:menu-altgr   3rd level of Menu
  compose:lctrl        Left Ctrl
  compose:lctrl-altgr  3rd level of Left Ctrl
  compose:rctrl        Right Ctrl
  compose:rctrl-altgr  3rd level of Right Ctrl
  compose:caps         Caps Lock
  compose:caps-altgr   3rd level of Caps Lock
  compose:102          &amp;lt;Less/Greater&amp;gt;
  compose:102-altgr    3rd level of &amp;lt;Less/Greater&amp;gt;
  compose:paus         Pause
  compose:prsc         PrtSc
  compose:sclk         Scroll Lock
</code></pre>

<p>Caps Lock is a good choice, but would make it harder to type anonymous hate mail
in all-caps to people not agreeing on my operating system preferences.
Therefore I pick the Menu key, which I didn't even use once in my dark Windows
days. The compose key can be defined in <code>~/.xinitrc</code>, ideally together with the
choice of the aforementioned imperialistic keyboard layout:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>setxkbmap us
setxkbmap -option compose:menu
</code></pre>

<p>On my Thinkpad (running Arch Linux), I prefer the PrtSc key, which is placed
between AltGr and Ctrl on the right hand side of the Space bar. I don't often
take screenshots, since the content of my screen is mostly text, which is
better captured using primary selection. (Did I already mention that I use
Arch, btw.?)</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>setxkbmap us
setxkbmap -option compose:prtsc
</code></pre>

<p>After restarting X, the compose key is ready for action. Now I can type <code>Menu "
O</code> to enter <em>Ö</em> on my PC (OpenBSD), or <code>PrtSc ' e</code> to enter <em>é</em> on my Laptop
(Arch Linux). Not all together at the same time, but as a sequence, which is
much more convenient.  Pre-defined sequences can be looked up in the compose
files under <code>/usr/X11/share/X11/locale/[locale]/Compose</code> on OpenBSD, or
<code>/us/share/X11/locale/[locale]/Compose</code> on Arch Linux, respectively. As locale,
I simply use <code>en_US.UTF-8</code> (imperialism, remember?), which gives me a wide
range of sequences (hand-picked examples):</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>&lt;Multi_key&gt; &lt;C&gt; &lt;o&gt;             : &quot;©&quot;   copyright # COPYRIGHT SIGN
&lt;Multi_key&gt; &lt;R&gt; &lt;o&gt;             : &quot;®&quot;   registered # REGISTERED SIGN
&lt;Multi_key&gt; &lt;plus&gt; &lt;minus&gt;      : &quot;±&quot;   plusminus # PLUS-MINUS SIGN
&lt;Multi_key&gt; &lt;s&gt; &lt;s&gt;             : &quot;ß&quot;   ssharp # LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S
&lt;Multi_key&gt; &lt;E&gt; &lt;equal&gt;         : &quot;€&quot;   EuroSign # EURO SIGN
&lt;Multi_key&gt; &lt;u&gt; &lt;slash&gt;         : &quot;µ&quot;   mu # MICRO SIGN
&lt;Multi_key&gt; &lt;quotedbl&gt; &lt;A&gt;      : &quot;Ä&quot;   Adiaeresis # LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH DIAERESIS
&lt;Multi_key&gt; &lt;acute&gt; &lt;E&gt;         : &quot;É&quot;   Eacute # LATIN CAPITAL LETTER E WITH ACUTE
&lt;Multi_key&gt; &lt;asciitilde&gt; &lt;N&gt;    : &quot;Ñ&quot;   Ntilde # LATIN CAPITAL LETTER N WITH TILDE
&lt;Multi_key&gt; &lt;comma&gt; &lt;c&gt;         : &quot;ç&quot;   ccedilla # LATIN SMALL LETTER C WITH CEDILLA
&lt;Multi_key&gt; &lt;v&gt; &lt;z&gt;             : &quot;ž&quot;   U017E # LATIN SMALL LETTER Z WITH CARON
</code></pre>

<p>Those sequences are very intuitive to type, so looking them up will hardly be
needed. This configuration also allows me to type in scientific
transliterations of Russian words, such as <em>Č</em> in <em>Čechov</em> (<code>Menu &lt; C</code>) instead
of the German <em>Tschechow</em> or the English <em>Chekov</em>. Same with <em>š</em> in <em>Puškin</em>
and <em>Ž</em> in <em>Dr. Živago</em>.</p>
<p>If those sequences do not suffice for one's particular needs, more sequences can
be defined in the file <code>~/.XCompose</code>. When doing so, it is important to also
include the original definitions mentioned above as follows, so that it's not
needed to re-define them all:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>include &quot;%S/en_US.UTF-8/Compose&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>%S</code> resolves to the path <code>/usr/X11R6/share/X11/locale</code> on OpenBSD and
<code>/usr/share/X11/locale</code> on Arch Linux. (<code>%L</code> would resolve to the current
locale and, thus, would be shorter, but I prefer the more explicit way using
<code>%S</code>.) Additional rules can be defined as follows:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>&lt;Multi_key&gt; &lt;colon&gt; &lt;minus&gt; &lt;parenright&gt; : &quot;☺&quot; U263A # WHITE SMILING FACE
</code></pre>

<p>This allows to type the smiley using <code>Menu : - )</code> on my OpenBSD machine, and
<code>PrtSc : - )</code> on my Arch Linux laptop. The left hand side of the colon defines
the key sequence. The right hand side defines a key symbol (<code>keysym</code> in X
lingo), a string, or both, followed by an optional comment. It is also possible
to enter whole strings in that manner:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>&lt;Multi_key&gt; &lt;m&gt; &lt;a&gt; &lt;c&gt; : &quot;fanboy&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Whose effect I leave for you to figure out.</p>
<h1>Update (2020-09-17)</h1>
<p>A former <a href="https://github.com/chefe">fellow student</a> just made me aware of the
keyboard variant <code>altgr-intl</code> for the US layout. It can be set as follows:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>$ setxkbmap us -variant altgr-intl
</code></pre>

<p>This layout variant offers some useful shortcuts, all to be entered in
combination with AltGr:</p>
<ul>
<li>AltGr + q: ä</li>
<li>AltGr + y: ü</li>
<li>AltGr + p: ö</li>
<li>AltGr + e: é</li>
<li>AltGr + r: ë</li>
<li>AltGr + s: ß</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, an e with grave accent is not easily available, but the
<code>altgr-intl</code> variant is still a good alternative for German.</p></div>
