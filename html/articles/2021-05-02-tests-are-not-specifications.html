        <div class="content"><p>In <em>The Clean Coder</em>, Chapter 7 (<em>Acceptance Tests</em>), Robert C. Martin writes
(p. 109):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But the real reason these tests aren't redundant is that their primary
function <em>is not testing</em>. The fact that they are tests is incidental. […]
The fact that they automatically verify the design, structure, and behaviour
that they specify is wildly useful, <strong>but the specification is their true
purpose</strong>. [Bold emphasis mine.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OK, boomer, here's your spec:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>assert f(0) == 1
assert f(-1) == -2
assert f(+1) == 4
assert f(+4) == 13
assert f(-9) == -26</code></pre>


<p>Now implement <code>f(x)</code>. The requirements are clear, aren't they?</p>
<p>You're still here? Where's the implementation!? I told you everything you need.
You got test cases! They <em>are</em> the specification; you just told me this, and of
course, <em>Uncle Bob is always right</em>, they told me in school.</p>
<p>Still not done? OK, you're fired. Here's the Python implementation. Easy, isn't
it?</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>def f(x):
    return (x + 2) * 3 - 5</code></pre>


<p>Those young developers are no good, after all. Let's hire one of those old
programmers, please bring in that old, more-arrogant-than-Uncle-Bob, grumpy
Dijkstra guy (<a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD09xx/EWD981.html">EWD
981</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At this stage I can give you some behavioural advice. Contrary to what
misguided—and misguiding—educationists may have told you, don't waste your
time looking at specific examples. Trying to come to grips with a large set by
looking at a few—hopefully representative—elements of that set is one of the
most ineffective ways of spending one's time. Go immediately for the general
case, or, in other words, <strong>attack the set not by looking at specific elements
but by analysing the definition of the set.</strong> [Bold emphasis mine.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So you're not interested in some randomly picked elements of both the problem
and solution set, but in those set's definition? Is that all you need? Well,
here's that definition:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>y = f(x) = (x + 2) * 3 - 5</code></pre>


<p>But I can also provide you with a set of test cases, or <em>specs</em>, as they are
called by some developers. Oh, you don't need them? But what is QA supposed to
do all day long then? You mean we can fire them? Wow, that sounds great. You're
hired, Mr. Dijkstra!</p>
<p>Did I hear this right, Mr. Dijkstra, <em>tests are not specifications</em>? Now you're
talking…</p></div>
