        <h3 class="author">Patrick Bucher</h3>
        <h3 class="date">2020-08-11</h3>
        <div class="content"><p>I'm a happy user of <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> both on my private
computers and on my work laptop. I even managed to get through four years of
university with my setup, and only had to bring a Windows machine on some rare
occasions, even though some professors are openly hostile towards a Linux setup.
(It doesn't run Microsoft Project and the real Excel, after all…)</p>
<p>Recently, I got interested in the BSDs, especially in
<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a> and in <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a>.
Even though OpenBSD with its minimalistic appeal is better suited to my taste,
I'm currently looking at FreeBSD for a couple of reasons. First, I have to
maintain a storage server (a FreeBSD box using ZFS) at work. Second, I've also
built up a storage server at home. FreeBSD gives me the things I need mostly out
of the box: ZFS with redundancy on really cheap hardware. And third, I just like
to learn new things.</p>
<h1>Why FreeBSD?</h1>
<p>However, when it comes to learning new things in my spare time, I'd rather spend
my time on something that will be useful in the long run. I use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect">Lindy
Effect</a> as a guide: Technologies
like Kubernetes, the latest JavaScript framework, or Web Assembly have only been
around for a couple of years, and it's possible that those will undergo major
changes or vanish alltogether as fast as they came. Older technologies <em>that are
still around nowadays</em>, on the other hand, can be expected to be around for many
more years. Examples are the C programming language, various Unix shells, and ‒
FreeBSD. (I also make exceptions to this rule now and then. For example, I
learned Go and Rust in the summers of 2018 and 2019, respectively. Go, which had
its 1.0 release earlier than Rust, proofed to be the more stable choice.)</p>
<p>FreeBSD is now more than 25 years old. Its roots, however, go back to AT&amp;T's
original Unix from the 1970s. (All the code has been replaced or rewritten
since.) Being old is not enough, of course; a technology is only worthwhile
learning if it is still alive. Even though FreeBSD is rarely on the front page
of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>, it is still widely used.
<a href="https://papers.freebsd.org/2019/fosdem/looney-netflix_and_freebsd/">Netflix</a>
streams videos through FreeBSD systems, and the operating system of the
PlayStation 4, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4_system_software">Orbis
OS</a>, is based on
FreeBSD.</p>
<p>FreeBSD is not only likely to stay around for a long time, it probably also
won't undergo fundmental changes very soon or very often. One example is the
startup system of FreeBSD, which is still based on <code>init</code> and <code>rc</code> scripts.
Ubuntu, on the other side, switched from SysVinit to Upstart in 2006, and again
from Upstart to systemd in 2015. That is one init system to learn for a lifetime
(FreeBSD) vs. three in less than a decade (Ubuntu).</p>
<p>Documentation is another advantage of FreeBSD. Having a system that rarely
introduces breaking changes makes it easier and more worthwile to provide good
documentation. The FreeBSD team not only provides good <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi">manual
pages</a>, but also a well curated
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/faq/">FAQs</a>, a
<a href="https://wiki.freebsd.org/">Wiki</a>, and the very useful
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/">Handbook</a>.
FreeBSD material has such a long shelf life so that it is even worthwhile to
print books about that operating system. I'm reading <a href="https://nostarch.com/absfreebsd3">Absolute
FreeBSD</a> now (from front to back, that is).
Michael Warren Lucas, the author of this book, has written <a href="https://www.tiltedwindmillpress.com/product-category/tech/">even more
books</a> on FreeBSD
(and OpenBSD), which are not only useful and of high-quality, but also
well-written and fun to read.</p>
<p>As I started to work with FreeBSD, I suddenly realized what the term
«distribution» is probably supposed to mean: Not just a bunch of software
cobbled together with more or less frequent upgrades, but an entire operating
system that not only provides working software, but also the means to build that
very software on a standard installation. (Such a system is technically
described as <em>self hosting</em>.) A kernel can be compiled and installed with a
single command. Thanks to the ports tree, the packages can be compiled easily
and in a consistent way. I haven't tried <em>all</em> Linux distributions, of course,
but quality standards that high are certainly not the rule in the GNU/Linux
world. (Debian and Arch, the Linux distributions I use the most and know the
best, are still absolutely great operating systems.)</p>
<h1>FreeBSD on the Desktop?</h1>
<p>It's safe to say that FreeBSD is a good choice for servers in a Unix
environment. But does it also work well on a desktop computer? And is it even an
option for the kind of desktop I like to run: not GNOE, KDE, or Xfce, but a
minimalistic setup based on <a href="http://dwm.suckless.org/">dwm</a>, which probably
isn't used by many. Since dwm can only be configured by modifying the <code>config.h</code>
file, I won't be able to use the version from the ports tree. I use my desktop
computer mainly for work (programming, reading, writing, researching information
on the internet) and some entertainment mostly provided through the web browser
(reading, videos).</p>
<p>I generally use mid-range commodity hardware with on-board graphics, so hardware
compatibility should not be an issue. My desktop computer is a small-form Dell
OptiPlex 7040 from 2016 with an Intel Core i5 CPU. I replaced the original 128
TB SSD with a 500 GB model last year, and upgraded the original 8 GB of memory
with a ridiculous amount of 24 GB. (Some RAM bars just happened to lay around
here…) The computer has a WiFi card, of course, but since my router is just next
to my desk, I rather use a stable ethernet connection.</p>
<p>I already tried out OpenBSD once on that computer, and didn't have any issues
getting it to run. So FreeBSD having access to the same code base under a
compatible license is likely to suppport this hardware as well. Let's just try
it out!</p>
<h1>Preparations</h1>
<p>FreeBSD supports multiple versions at any given point in time. At the time of
this writing, 12.1 and 11.4 are the current versions intended for production.
Let's pick the most recent version 12.1. The <a href="https://download.freebsd.org/ftp/releases/amd64/amd64/ISO-IMAGES/12.1/">download
page</a>
for the <code>amd64</code> architecture offers various options. The compressed
<code>mini-memstick</code> archive weighs the least and provides everything that is needed
for an installation on a computer with internet connection. I download it to my
laptop running Arch Linux, and then verify the checksum:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>$ wget https://download.freebsd.org/ftp/releases/amd64/amd64\
/ISO-IMAGES/12.1/FreeBSD-12.1-RELEASE-amd64-mini-memstick.img.xz
$ wget https://download.freebsd.org/ftp/releases/amd64/amd64/\
ISO-IMAGES/12.1/CHECKSUM.SHA512-FreeBSD-12.1-RELEASE-amd64
$ sha512sum -c CHECKSUM.SHA512-FreeBSD-12.1-RELEASE-amd64 --ignore-missing
FreeBSD-12.1-RELEASE-amd64-mini-memstick.img.xz: OK
</code></pre>

<p>The archive (389 MBs) needs to be unpacked and is then copied to a USB dongle
(<code>/dev/sda</code>):</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>$ unxz FreeBSD-12.1-RELEASE-amd64-mini-memstick.img.xz
# dd if=FreeBSD-12.1-RELEASE-amd64-mini-memstick.img of=/dev/sda bs=1M
$ sync
</code></pre>

<h1>Initial Setup</h1>
<p>The BIOS is setup to use UEFI rather than legacy boot. I plug in the USB dongle
and start the FreeBSD installer. These are the settings I use during setup:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keymap: Swiss-German (<code>ch.kdb</code>)</li>
<li>Hostname: <code>optiplex</code> (I'm not very imaginative when it comes to naming
  things.)</li>
<li>Components: just <code>lib32</code>, <code>ports</code>, and <code>src</code></li>
<li>Network: interface <code>em0</code> with DHCP and IPv4</li>
<li>Mirror: Main Site</li>
<li>Partitioning: Auto (UFS, I'm going to learn about ZFS later) on the entire
  disk <code>ada0</code> using GPT and the following partitions (device, space, type,
  label, mount point):<ul>
<li><code>ada0p1</code>: 200 MB <code>efi</code> boot (no mount point)</li>
<li><code>ada0p2</code>: 24 GB <code>freebsd-swap</code> swap0 (no mount point, size of physical memory)</li>
<li><code>ada0p3</code>: 16 GB <code>freebsd-ufs</code> root <code>/</code></li>
<li><code>ada0p4</code>: 4 GB <code>freebsd-ufs</code> temp <code>/tmp</code></li>
<li><code>ada0p5</code>: 4 GB <code>freebsd-ufs</code> var <code>/var</code></li>
<li><code>ada0p6</code>: 32 GB <code>freebsd-ufs</code> usr <code>/usr</code></li>
<li><code>ada0p7</code>: 386 GB <code>freebsd-ufs</code> home <code>/home</code> (remainder of the space)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Root password: I won't tell you, but a strong one!</li>
<li>CMOS clock: UTC</li>
<li>Time Zone: Europe/Switzerland (<code>CEST</code>)</li>
<li>Services: <code>sshd</code>, <code>moused</code>, <code>ntpd</code>, <code>powerd</code>, and <code>dumpdev</code></li>
<li>Security Hardening Options: everything</li>
<li>User: <code>patrick</code> with additional group <code>wheel</code> (to become root), the <code>tcsh</code>
  shell, a strong password, and, otherwise, suggested settings</li>
</ul>
<p>It can be argued if the chosen partition sizes are reasonable. However, it is
always a good idea to use separate <code>/tmp</code> and <code>/var</code> partitions to make sure
that no process can fill up the entire disk. (Using a separate <code>/usr</code> partition
is an issue on Linux nowadays, since the widely used init system systemd
requires access to <code>/usr</code>. On FreeBSD, it is still possible to do so without any
issues.)</p>
<p>Make sure to use <code>efi</code> as the type for the boot partition, not <code>freebsd-boot</code> as
suggested in <em>Absolute FreeBSD</em> (3rd Edition on page 36).</p>
<h1>First Boot, First Issues</h1>
<p>After the installation, I choose to shutdown the system. I unplug my USB dongle
as soon as the screen turns black.</p>
<p>Before the first boot, I have to change my boot options in the BIOS so that the
computer boots from the SSD on which FreeBSD was just installed.</p>
<p>The system boots and even shows my mouse on the terminal! The network is up and
running. However, there is a message warning me that the leapsecond file is
expired. The
<a href="https://forums.FreeBSD.org/threads/leapseconds-file-expired.56645/post-322290">solution</a> suggested in the FreeBSD Forum</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code># service ntpd onefetch
</code></pre>

<p>fails with a certificate verification error. A <a href="https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=230017">bug
report</a> suggest to
install the package <code>ca_root_nss</code>:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code># pkg install ca_root_nss
</code></pre>

<p>Which not only installs the package management software, but also solves the
issue above: The warning concerning the leapsecond file doesn't appear after the
next boot. Now that the basic system is up and running, let's tackle the GUI!</p>
<h1>Installing the GUI</h1>
<p>Since <em>Absolute FreeBSD</em> doesn't cover graphical user interfaces, I have to
resort to the handbook. In <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/x-install.html">Chapter
5.3</a> it says that the
easiest way to setup the X Window System is to install the <code>xorg</code> package. Since
I prefer a minimalistic setup, I opt for the <code>x11/xorg-minimal</code> package instead:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code># pkg install x11/xorg-minimal
</code></pre>

<p>This package depends on Python 3.7, Perl 5, and Wayland, among others, and
weighs roughly 1 GB, which is not exactly minimalistic in my opinion. On the
other hand, it is notable that the base setup works without Perl or Python.
(Which <em>is</em> minimalistic.)</p>
<h2>Compiling <code>dwm</code></h2>
<p>Since I like to keep my <code>dwm</code> version up to date, I fetch the sources using
<code>git</code>, which first needs to be installed:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code># pkg install git
# git clone https://git.suckless.org/dwm
</code></pre>

<p>A first naive compilation attempt fails:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code># cd dwm
# make
drw.c:5:10: fatal error: 'X11/Xlib.h' file not found
#include &lt;X11/Xlib.h&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>config.mk</code> file expects the header files to be located under
<code>/usr/X11R6/include</code>. However, FreeBSD has those files stored under a different
location:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code># find / -type f -name Xlib.h
/usr/local/include/X11/Xlib.h
</code></pre>

<p>So in <code>config.mk</code>, the lines</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>X11INC = /usr/X11R6/include
X11LIB = /usr/X11R6/lib
</code></pre>

<p>need to be replaced with</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>X11INC = /usr/local/include
X11LIB = /usr/local/lib
</code></pre>

<p>The next compilation fails with another error (different error message, yay!):</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code># make
drw.c:6:10: fatal error: 'X11/Xft/Xft.h' file not found
</code></pre>

<p>That's the price I have to pay for minimalism, I guess. Executing <code>pkg search
Xft</code> reveals the package <code>libXft</code>, which I install:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code># pkg install libXft
</code></pre>

<p>This shows to be a good idea, because now I'm getting a different error message:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code># make
Xft.h:39:10: fatal error: 'ft2build.h' file not found
</code></pre>

<p>It turns out that the file is on the system, but cannot be found:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code># find / -type f -name ft2build.h
/usr/local/include/freetype2/ft2build.h
</code></pre>

<p>Again, the <code>local</code> path segment is missing in <code>config.mk</code>:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>FREETYPEINC = /usr/include/freetype2
</code></pre>

<p>Which is changed as follows:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>FREETYPEINC = /usr/local/include/freetype2
</code></pre>

<p>Retry, fresh error again:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code># make
dwm.c:40:10: fatal error: 'X11/extensions/Xinerama.h' file not found
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>config.mk</code> contains the following section:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code># Xinerama, comment if you don't want it
XINERAMALIBS  = -lXinerama
XINERAMAFLAGS = -DXINERAMA
</code></pre>

<p>So what is <em>Xinerama</em>, after all? According to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinerama">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Xinerama is an extension to the X Window System that enables X
applications and window managers to use two or more physical displays as
one large virtual display. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since I have only one screen, I can do without Xinerama, so I comment out those
lines:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code># Xinerama, comment if you don't want it
# XINERAMALIBS  = -lXinerama
# XINERAMAFLAGS = -DXINERAMA
</code></pre>

<p>Now <code>dwm</code> compiles, and I can install it:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code># make dwm
# make install
</code></pre>

<h2>Starting Xorg with <code>dwm</code></h2>
<p>I switch to my personal account and create the file <code>/home/patrick/.xinitrc</code>
with the following content:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>exec dwm
</code></pre>

<p>Now I run <code>startx</code>, which unfortunately fails:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>Fatal server error:
(EE) no screens found(EE)
</code></pre>

<p>The error log <code>/var/log/Xorg.0.log</code> does not offer any additional information
that seems helpful to me. It turns out that <code>/etc/X11</code> is empty. <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/x-config.html">Section
5.4</a> of the handbook is
about Xorg configuration. I create a minimalistic configuration for my graphics
card (onboard Intel GPU) in <code>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</code>:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>Section &quot;Device&quot;
    Identifier &quot;Card0&quot;
    Driver     &quot;intel&quot;
EndSection
</code></pre>

<p>I also need to install the display driver with the matching kernel module,
because my choice of <code>xorg-minimal</code> from before.</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code># pkg install xf86-video-intel drm-kmod
</code></pre>

<p>(Note that «drm» doesn't stand for «digital rights management» in this context,
but for «direct rendering modules».) The kernel module can be activated on
startup by adding it to the <code>rc.conf</code> as follows:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code># echo 'lkd_list=&quot;/boot/modules/i915kms.ko&quot;' &gt;&gt; /etc/rc.conf
</code></pre>

<p>After a restart, the console is shown in a much higher resolution. However,
<code>startx</code> now complains about a missing font. Let's install the <code>xorg-fonts</code> meta
package, which should provide a monospace font needed for <code>dwm</code>:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code># pkg install xorg-fonts
</code></pre>

<p>Now, finally, <code>dwm</code> works! Since <code>startx</code> is long to type, I define the alias
<code>x</code> for it in <code>~/.cshrc</code>:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>alias x startx
</code></pre>

<p>And start <code>dwm</code>:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>$ x
</code></pre>

<h2>Configure <code>dwm</code></h2>
<p>By default, <code>dwm</code> uses the Alt key as the modifier key (<code>MODKEY</code>). I prefer to
use the «Windows» or «Super» Key, for it has no other purpose on my system.
(<code>Alt</code> is useful for some emacs-style readline commands.) To do this, the
<code>MODKEY</code> variable has to be changed in <code>config.h</code> as follows:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>#define MODKEY Mod4Mask
</code></pre>

<p>The default rules make Firefox appear on the last tag, and Gimp to be used with
floating layout, which makes no sense with more recent versions of Gimp. Let's
just undefine those rules:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>static const Rule rules[] = {
    {NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, 0, -1},
};
</code></pre>

<p>I also like my windows to be split evenly:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>static const float mact = 0.50;
</code></pre>

<p>As a terminal, let's use <code>qterminal</code> instead of <code>st</code>, for the latter does not
support scrollback buffers:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>static const char *termcmd[] = {&quot;qterminal&quot;, NULL};
</code></pre>

<p><code>qterminal</code> and <code>dmenu</code> need to be installed:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code># pkg install qterminal dmenu
</code></pre>

<h2>Status Line</h2>
<p><code>dwm</code> can display status information using the <code>xsetroot</code> command. The text to
be displayed is computed in a background task that can be defined in <code>.xinitrc</code>.
On laptops, I usually print the battery status. On desktops, the current date
and time suffices. Here's the <code>.xinitrc</code> that displays this information
(surrounded by spaces) in five second intervals:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>while true
do
    xsetroot -name &quot; $(date +'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M') &quot;
done &amp;
setxkbmap ch
exec dwm
</code></pre>

<p>The keymap is also set to the <code>ch</code> (i.e. Swiss German) variant just before
executing <code>dwm</code>. The <code>xsetroot</code> and <code>setxkbmap</code> utilities need to be installed
for this:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code># pkg install xsetroot setxkbmap
</code></pre>

<h2>Volume Control</h2>
<p>In order to test audio, let's download the Free Software Song:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>$ curl https://www.gnu.org/music/free-software-song.ogg &gt; fss.ogg
</code></pre>

<p>I prefer <code>mplayer</code>, which needs to be installed:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code># pkg install mplayer
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure to include <code>/usr/local/bin</code> in your <code>$PATH</code> variable in order to run
<code>mplayer</code> without further path specification (<code>.cshrc</code>):</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>export PATH=&quot;$PATH:/usr/local/bin&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Playing the song as follows works if I plug in a headphone into one of the front
audio sockets:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>$ mplayer fss.ogg
</code></pre>

<p>The devices are listed in <code>/dev/sndstat</code> and switched by setting the respective
device number:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code># sysctl hw.snd.dfault_unit=1
</code></pre>

<p>The default volume is set to 85, which is quite loud for Richard Stallman's
singing voice. The volume can be changed relatively or absolutely using the
<code>mixer</code> command:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>$ mixer vol -10
Setting the mixer from 85:85 to 75:75
$ mixer vol 50
Setting the mixer from 75:75 to 50:50
</code></pre>

<p>I don't always want to type that command, but rather use the volume keys on my
keyboard. So let's add a couple of commands to the <code>dwm</code> config (<code>config.h</code>,
just before the <code>keys[]</code> section):</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>static const char *upvol[] = {&quot;mixer&quot;, &quot;vol&quot;, &quot;+5&quot;});
static const char *downvol[] = {&quot;mixer&quot;, &quot;vol&quot;, &quot;-5&quot;});
</code></pre>

<p>For the key mapping, I first need to figure out the key codes for my volume
keys, which can be done using <code>xev</code>:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code># pkg install xev
$ xev &gt; xev.out
</code></pre>

<p>Just press the volume up and volume up button in that order. Then close the
<code>xev</code> window and inspect <code>xev.out</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Unfortunately, the volume keys do not trigger an event.</strong> There must be
something wrong with the keyboard configuration. So let's use Page Up and Page
Down to increase and decrese the volume (<code>keys[]</code> array in <code>config.h</code>):</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>static Key keys[] = {
    // lines omitted
    { MODKEY, XK_Page_Up,   spawn, {.v = upvol}   },
    { MODKEY, XK_Page_Down, spawn, {.v = downvol} },
};
</code></pre>

<p>Then simply re-compile, re-install, and re-start <code>dwm</code>:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code># make install
$ x
</code></pre>

<p>Now Richard Stallman can be made to sing louder or quieter by pressing
Super+PgUp and Super+PgDown, respectively, <em>which is goood, hackers, which is,
goo-oo-ood!</em></p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Setting up the FreeBSD base system was rather easy. I made the mistake of using
<code>freebsd-boot</code> and not <code>efi</code> as the partition type for the boot partition, which
seems to be a mistake in the otherwise amazing book <em>Absolute FreeBSD</em>.</p>
<p>Installing the <code>x11/xorg-minimal</code> package instead of the full <code>xorg</code> package
caused some additional trouble, but helped me to better understand which
components are actually required to compile and run <code>dwm</code>. Instead of just
installing Xinerama, as I always did on Linux, the extra pain of libraries not
found made me investigate if I actually need that component. It turned out, I
don't.</p>
<p>I also needed to install the graphics driver and according kernel module
manually. Doing so, I realized that FreeBSD offers a nice graphical console,
which is a good fit for a <code>tmux</code> environment I use once in a while to work
absolutely focused.</p>
<p>Having audio running (almost) out of the box was a positive surprise. The
<code>mixer</code> interface is very simplistic. Switching audio devices, however, requires
an option to be changed using <code>sysctl</code>. This calls for some additional <code>dwm</code>
shortcuts!</p>
<p>My keyboard (a Cherry board with MX Brown switches) doesn't work properly out of
the box. I read about <code>uhidd</code>, which could be used to fix my issue with the
volume keys. But for the moment, I have a working setup.</p>
<p>I'll come back to the open issues in a later article. But first, I'd like to
work with my new FreeBSD desktop as much as possible to gain more experience.</p></div>
